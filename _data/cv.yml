    - title: Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor
      institution: Mentors:: Charles L. Bennett, Tobias A. Marriage, Ivan L. Padilla
      year: 2019 - 2023
      description:
        - Component Separation Algorithm:: Implemented the needlet internal linear combination (NILC) for foreground component separation. Tested the algorithm under different foreground conditions. Used pixel covariance to reduce the NILC bias at large angular scale.
        - Polarized Foreground Masks:: Constructed masks based on polarized intensity with WMAP and Planck maps specific to the CLASS scanning region. Tested power spectrum estimators' performances over different polarization masks.
        - Instrumentation:: Assisted in designing telescope components with SolidWorks. Assembled CLASS cryogenic receivers. Used Tormach CNC to produce infrared filters for the CLASS detector assembly.
