    - title: Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor
      institution: "Mentors: Charles L. Bennett, Tobias A. Marriage, Ivan L. Padilla"
      year: 2019 - 2023
      description:
        - "<b>Component Separation Algorithm</b>: Implemented the needlet internal linear combination (NILC) for foreground component separation. Tested the algorithm under different foreground conditions. Used pixel covariance to reduce the NILC bias at large angular scale."
        - "<b>Polarized Foreground Masks</b>: Constructed masks based on polarized intensity with WMAP and Planck maps specific to the CLASS scanning region. Tested power spectrum estimators' performances over different polarization masks."
        - "<b>Instrumentation</b>: Assisted in designing telescope components with SolidWorks. Assembled CLASS cryogenic receivers. Used Tormach CNC to produce infrared filters for the CLASS detector assembly."

    - title: Zakamska Stellar Astrophysics Group
      institution: "Mentor: Nadia L. Zakamska, Hsiang-Chih Hwang"
      year: 2021 - 2023
      description:
        - "<b>Cataclysmic Variable</b>: First-authored paper on the puzzling cataclysmic variable CSS1603+19. Performed various analysis over infrared and optical observations. Demystified unusual emission structure from the system. Concluded with a physical model for this system including the stellar mass and radius of the system."
        - "<b>Time-Domain Astrophysics</b>: Designed a range of routines for decoding photometry and spectroscopy observations. Identified fine line and continuum structure from large data sets."
        - "<b>PypeIt Data Reduction</b>: Reduce raw GNIRS near-infrared exposures with data-reduction pipeline PypeIt."
