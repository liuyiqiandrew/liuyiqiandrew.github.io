My name is Yiqi Liu (刘逸奇). I usually go by Andrew. I am currently a physics graduate student at Princeton University. My research focus is cosmology. I study the origin of the universe via the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

Before coming to Princeton, I finished my undergraduate degree at Johns Hopkins University majoring in applied math, physics, and pure math.

At Hopkins, I worked with Prof. [Tobias Marriage](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/tobias-marriage/) and Prof. [Charles Bennett](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/charles-l-bennett/) on the [Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS)](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/class/) project. In addition, I worked with Prof. [Nadia Zakamska](http://zakamska.johnshopkins.edu/) researching a bizzare cataclysmic variable system.

I like to row and ski during my free time.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
